  <div id="demo" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
    Blood is essential to life. Blood circulates through our body and delivers essential substances like oxygen and nutrients to the body’s cells. It also transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. There is no substitute for blood. It cannot be made or manufactured. Generous blood donors are the only source of blood for patients in need of a blood transfusion.
    </div>
    </div><br>
    <div class="container">
        <button type="button" style="background-color:#00b894 ;Color:snow;" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo2">Blood components</button>
        <div id="demo2" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
      There are four basic components that comprise human blood: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and
          platelets.

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo5">White Blood Cells</button>
    <div id="demo2" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
        Red blood cells represent 40%-45% of your blood volume. They are generated from your bone marrow at a rate of
        four to five billion per hour. They have a lifecycle of about 120 days in the body.
        </div>
    <div id="demo3" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
        Platelets are an amazing part of your blood. Platelets are the smallest of our blood cells and literally look
        like small plates in their non-active form. Platelets control bleeding. Wherever a wound occurs, the blood
        vessel will send out a signal. Platelets receive that signal and travel to the area and transform into their
        “active” formation, growing long tentacles to make contact with the vessel and form clusters to plug the wound
        until it heals.
        </div>
  <div id="demo4" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
    Plasma is the liquid portion of your blood. Plasma is yellowish in color and is made up mostly of water, but it
    also contains proteins, sugars, hormones and salts. It transports water and nutrients to your body’s tissues.
    </div>
  <div id="demo5" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
    Although white blood cells (leukocytes) only account for about 1% of your blood, they are very important. White
    blood cells are essential for good health and protection against illness and disease. Like red blood cells, they
    are constantly being generated from your bone marrow. They flow through the bloodstream and attack foreign
    bodies, like viruses and bacteria. They can even leave the bloodstream to extend the fight into tissue

    <div id="demo6" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
        There are 4 main blood groups (types of blood) – A, B, AB and O. Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents.

        Each group can be either RhD positive or RhD negative, which means in total there are 8 blood groups.

    <div id="demo7" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
    Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Your blood group is identified by antibodies and antigens in the blood.

        Antibodies are proteins found in plasma. They're part of your body's natural defences. They recognise foreign substances, such as germs, and alert your immune system, which destroys them.
        
        Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of red blood cells.

        <button type="button" style="background-color:#00b894 ;Color:snow;" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo8">ABO System</button>
        <div id="demo8" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
    There are 4 main blood groups defined by the ABO system:<br>
    blood group A – has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma,
    <br>
    blood group B – has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma,
    <br>     
    blood group O – has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma,
    <br>    
    blood group AB – has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies.
        <br>
        Blood group O is the most common blood group. Almost half of the UK population (48%) has blood group O.
        <br>
        Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.
        <br>
        This is why group A blood must never be given to someone who has group B blood and vice versa.
        <br>
        As group O red blood cells do not have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group.
        <br>
        The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) website has more information about the different blood groups.
        </div>
        </div><br>
        <div class="container">
            <button type="button" style="background-color:#00b894 ;Color:snow;" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo9">The RH System</button>
            <div id="demo9" class="collapse" style="background-color:white";>
    Red blood cells sometimes have another antigen, a protein known as the RhD antigen. If this is present, your blood group is RhD positive. If it's absent, your blood group is RhD negative.
    <br>
        This means you can be 1 of 8 blood groups:
        <br>
        A RhD positive (A+),
        <br>
        A RhD negative (A-),<br>
        B RhD positive (B+),<br>
        B RhD negative (B-),<br>
        O RhD positive (O+),<br>
        O RhD negative (O-),<br>
        AB RhD positive (AB+),<br>
        AB RhD negative (AB-).<br>
        About 85% of the UK population is RhD positive (36% of the population has O+, the most common type).<br>
        
        In most cases, O RhD negative blood (O-) can safely be given to anyone. It's often used in medical emergencies when the blood type is not immediately known.
        <br>
        It's safe for most recipients because it does not have any A, B or RhD antigens on the surface of the cells, and is compatible with every other ABO and RhD blood group.</p>

    <h2>Blood Types in Pregnancy</h2>
    <p>If two parents have different blood types, the mother will not necessarily have the same blood type or Rh factor as the child.<br>
        If the mother has Rh-negative blood, and the child has Rh-positive, this can pose a risk during pregnancy and delivery.<br>
        A small number of red blood cells from the fetus’ circulation can cross the placenta and enter the mother’s bloodstream. Anti-RhD antibody can then develop in the mother’s plasma, in a process known as sensitization.<br>
        A problem can arise if this antibody then detects a “foreign” antigen in the fetus’ blood cells. The antibodies may start to attack the fetus’ red blood cells as a defense mechanism.<br>
        In some cases, severe jaundice can result, and possibly brain damage.<br>
        An injection of anti-RhD immune globulin G can help prevent the mother from producing this antibody and reduce the impact of a sensitizing event on the fetus.<br>
        If a woman has Rh-negative blood, a doctor may administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and 34 weeks as a preventive measure, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).<br>
        Blood testing during pregnancy can predict possible risks by checking whether the fetus’ blood type is compatible with the mother’s.</p>

    <p>A blood test can determine an individual’s blood type.

        To test blood, a healthcare provider will take a small sample, usually from the person’s arm.
        
        In a lab, a technician mixes the individual’s blood with three different substances to see how they react. Each substance will contain A antibodies, B antibodies, or Rh factor.
        
        The antibodies will cause a different reaction in each case. If the blood is incompatible, it will clump. Observing these reactions will enable the technician to identify a person’s blood type.
        
        Before a person can receive donated blood, the technician will test the reaction by mixing a sample of the donor’s blood with that of the recipient.
        
        Specialist technicians carefully test all blood and blood products before use.</p>

    <h3>Heart Disease</h3>
    <p>There’s good news for O blood types. Research shows your risk of coronary heart disease tends to be lower. Experts aren’t sure why. Some think it might be because other types are more likely to have higher cholesterol and higher amounts of a protein that’s linked to clotting.</p>
    <img src="HT.jpg" alt="Heart Disease" height="435" width="652">
    <br>
    <h3>Stomach Cancer</h3>
    <p>A, AB, and B blood types are more at risk than type Os. Specifically, people with type A blood are more likely to get stomach cancer. Researchers think this might be because H. pylori infection is more common in people with type A blood. That’s a bacteria that’s usually found in the stomach. It can cause inflammation and ulcers.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="SC.jpg" alt="Stomach Cancer" height="435" width="652">
    <br>
    <h3>Memory</h3>
    <p>A small study showed that people with memory problems had type AB blood more than any other.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="M.jpg" alt="Memory" height="435" width="652">
    <br>
    <h3>Pancreatic Cancer</h3>
    <p>Your risk is higher if you’re type A, AB, or B. Molecules in type A and B red blood cells help certain bacteria called H. pylori grow in your gut. It can make you more likely to get pancreatic cancer.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="PC.jpg" alt="Pancreatic Cancer" height="435" width="652">
    <br>
    <h3>Malaria</h3>
    <p>Type O blood may help ward off this disease. You can get malaria when an infected mosquito bites you. The parasite that causes it has a harder time attaching itself to type O blood cells.</p>
    <img src="MA.jpg" alt="Malaria" height="435" width="652">
    <br>
    <h3>Ulcers</h3>
    <p>Peptic ulcers -- painful open sores that crop up in the lining of your stomach or upper intestine -- seem to happen more often with blood type O. </p>
    <br>
    <img src="UL.jpg" alt="Ulcers" height="435" width="652">
    <br>
    <h3>Blood Clots</h3>
    <p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is when your blood clots in a deep vein, like the ones in your legs. These clots sometimes move to your lungs. Research shows that people with type A, B, or AB blood are at a higher risk of VTE.</p>
    <img src="B.jpg" alt="Blood Clots" height="435" width="652">
    <br>
    <h3>Diabetes</h3>
    <p>Type 2 diabetes seems to happen more often in people with blood types A and B. Experts aren't sure why. More research is needed.</p>
    <img src="DB.jpg" alt="Diabetes" height="630" width="1200">
    <br>
    <h3>Strokes</h3>
    <p>Your risk for a stroke goes up if you have blood type AB. Doctors think that’s because it’s more likely to clot than other types.</p>
